# Fletty (Work in Progress)
## A project to display time and weather from multiple international locations

<br/>

### Why

In my current role, I work closely with a truly international team of colleagues ranging from the UK (where I live) to Melbourne and Tokyo to San Jose - and everywhere in between!

I wanted to build on and develop new skills with the general architecture in mind:
* Utilise Python to handle the back end
* Utilise Arduino/Raspberry Pi to access the data
* Implement a Matrix dot to display the data
